As you can see, we have two stopped containers and we can remove it by using the following command:
```bash
# Format
# docker rm <container_id> <container_id>
docker rm 8363d62f8149 c6905638d5b3
```

Besides leaving the container in the stopped state, we can run a container and throw it away when finished by specifying `--rm` option:
```bash
docker run --rm busybox echo "Hello from busybox"
```

## Start an interactive shell inside a busybox container
The `-it` option attaches us to an interactive tty inside container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm busybox sh
```

Type `exit` to exit the interactive tty command session:
```bash
# Within container
exit
```
