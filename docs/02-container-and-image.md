# Container and Image

## Container
In general, container act like a sandbox for executing the application. It can run on the virtual machine or within the bare metal. Also, it's more lightweight compared with the virtual machine, which makes it became the standard way for running application.

## Image
To run the container, we need to specify what package should installed, what environment variables included, or what command needs to run in the container? You can share the images to the public image registry like docker hub.
